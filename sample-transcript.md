Alex: Hi Lisa, thanks for taking the call today. I know you're evaluating solutions to streamline your customer onboarding process.
Lisa: Yes, exactly. Right now it takes us about 3-4 weeks to get new clients fully set up, and we're losing some deals because competitors are promising faster turnaround times.
Alex: That's a challenge we hear frequently. Our platform typically reduces onboarding time to 5-7 days. We automate document collection, integrate with DocuSign for contracts, and provide real-time progress tracking for both your team and the client.
Lisa: Interesting. How does the client experience work?
Alex: They receive a personalized portal where they can upload documents, schedule training sessions, and track their setup progress. Everything is branded to your company, so it feels seamless. Clients love having visibility instead of wondering what's happening behind the scenes.
Lisa: We definitely get a lot of "what's the status" calls. What about on our internal side?
Alex: Your team gets automated task assignments, deadline alerts, and can see bottlenecks immediately. One of our clients reduced their internal coordination time by 60% because everyone knew exactly what needed to happen next.
Lisa: That sounds promising. What would implementation look like for us?
Alex: We'd start with a 2-week setup period to configure your workflows and integrate with your existing systems. Then we'd run a pilot with 5-10 new clients to refine the process before full rollout.
Lisa: And pricing?
Alex: For a company your size, it's $2,400 per month, which includes unlimited onboarding workflows and up to 50 active client projects at a time.
Lisa: Let me discuss this with my team. Can you send over some case studies from similar companies?
Alex: Absolutely. I'll also include a demo link so you can see the client portal experience. Would Thursday work for a follow-up call to answer any questions that come up?
Lisa: Thursday at 2 PM works perfectly.
Alex: Great, I'll send a calendar invite. Thanks Lisa!
