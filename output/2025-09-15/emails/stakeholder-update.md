# Stakeholder Update Email

**Subject:** Update from GrowthTech Inc. - DataSync Solutions Demo - September 15, 2025

Dear {STAKEHOLDER_NAME},

I wanted to provide you with a brief update following our GrowthTech Inc. - DataSync Solutions Demo meeting on September 15, 2025.

## Key Highlights
- **Strong Client Interest**: GrowthTech Inc. showed significant interest in our customer onboarding platform solution
- **Clear Pain Point Identified**: Their current 3-4 week onboarding timeline is causing competitive disadvantage and lost deals
- **Compelling Value Proposition**: Our solution promises to reduce onboarding to 5-7 days with 60% reduction in internal coordination time
- **Positive Reception**: Client appreciated our automated document collection, DocuSign integration, and branded client portal features

## Decisions Made
- Lisa Chen (Operations Director) will discuss the proposal with her internal team
- Follow-up call scheduled for Thursday at 2 PM to address team questions
- We will provide case studies and demo access for their internal review

## Impact on Your Area
**Sales Team**: Potential $28,800 annual contract ($2,400/month recurring revenue)
**Implementation Team**: 2-week setup period required if deal closes
**Product Team**: Platform demonstrates strong market fit for mid-size companies facing onboarding challenges
**Customer Success**: New client would require support for 50 concurrent client projects

## Next Steps
- Immediate delivery of case studies and demo access
- Thursday follow-up call to address technical integration questions
- Potential pilot program discussion if internal review is positive
- Contract negotiations may follow if pilot is approved

## Timeline
- **Immediate**: Case studies and demo link delivery
- **Thursday 2 PM**: Follow-up call with GrowthTech team
- **Next Week**: Potential pilot program parameters discussion
- **Following 2-3 weeks**: Contract negotiations if approved

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns about these developments.

Best regards,
{SENDER_NAME}
